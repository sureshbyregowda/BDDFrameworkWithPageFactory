$ mvn test

**To run specific scenario:**
$ mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @smoke"

			com.ecommerce.ebay.cucumberspecifics
									 TestRunner.java ---  TestRunner File is used to build a Communication between Feature Files and StepDefinition Files.

			com.ecommerce.ebay.hooks
									hooks.java - used for setup and teardown of the environment before and after each scenario
			
			com.ecommerce.ebay.pages
									- It has web elements corresponds to the specific pages and also contains Page methods which perform operations on those WebElements.
